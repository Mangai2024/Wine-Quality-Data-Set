# Wine-Quality-Data-Set
 

## Overview
This dataset contains physicochemical properties and quality ratings for red and white wines. 
It can be used for regression or classification tasks to predict wine quality based on its features.

## Data Source
The dataset appears to be derived from laboratory tests and sensory evaluation of wines. The 
data covers multiple chemical attributes and quality scores assigned by wine tasters.

## File Details
- **File Name**: Wine_Quality_Data.xlsx
- **Sheet Name**: Wine_Quality_Data

## Features
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **fixed_acidity**: Fixed acids in the wine (g/L).
2. **volatile_acidity**: Volatile acidity levels (g/L).
3. **citric_acid**: Citric acid concentration (g/L).
4. **residual_sugar**: Residual sugar content (g/L).
5. **chlorides**: Chloride levels (g/L).
6. **free_sulfur_dioxide**: Free sulfur dioxide concentration (mg/L).
7. **total_sulfur_dioxide**: Total sulfur dioxide concentration (mg/L).
8. **density**: Wine density (g/cmÂ³).
9. **pH**: Acidity level.
10. **sulphates**: Sulphate concentration (g/L).
11. **alcohol**: Alcohol percentage by volume (%).
12. **quality**: Quality score (integer, typically between 0-10).
13. **color**: Wine color (categorical: "red" or "white").

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Exploratory data analysis to understand correlations between chemical properties and wine quality.
- Predictive modeling to classify wine quality based on its physicochemical attributes.
